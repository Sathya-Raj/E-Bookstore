"An Ebook website demonstrating the concept of database management system" 
E-bookstore is a web-based platform that enables users to both buy and publish their own
books. By allowing users to login as authors, this store promotes local talent, all while being
a safe haven during trialling times.
This website manages the details of the books, reader, authors and the orders placed by both. It also displays the latest books on its home page. The purpose of the project is to build a web application program so as to have easy access to
books;
